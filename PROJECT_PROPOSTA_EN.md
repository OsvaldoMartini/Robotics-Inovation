# Executive Summary – Intelligent Prosthetics Project for People with Disabilities

## 1. Context and Motivation

The project aims to develop **intelligent robotic prosthetics** for people with physical disabilities, focusing on mobility, accessibility, and quality of life.

The Brazilian context presents a strong unmet demand for assistive technological solutions that are accessible, reliable, and adapted to the national socioeconomic reality. Currently, access to high-tech prosthetics is limited due to high import costs and the lack of domestic production at a competitive scale.

## 2. Project Stage

The project is currently at the stage of a **functional initial prototype**.

The following have already been carried out:

* Conceptual biomechanical studies.
* Identification of suitable sensors (EMG, gyroscopes, accelerometers).
* Evaluation of lightweight and resistant materials (high-performance polymers and metal alloys).

The next step is to consolidate the prototype in a controlled test environment, perform algorithm calibration, and start partnerships for trials with users in specialized clinics.

## 3. Technological Innovation

* Use of **biomedical sensors** for capturing muscular and neurological signals.
* Integration of **embedded AI** for continuous learning of each user’s movement patterns.
* Modular and low-cost structure, allowing **individual customization**.
* Intuitive human-machine interface, with potential integration to mobile applications.

## 4. Social and Economic Impact

* Significant improvement in mobility, autonomy, and self-esteem of people with disabilities.
* Reduction of dependency on high-cost imported prosthetics.
* Potential for generating qualified jobs in biomedical engineering, robotics, and industrial production.
* Alignment with social inclusion, accessibility, and public health policies.

## 5. Technical Feasibility and Partnerships

Development will rely on strategic partnerships with **EMBRAPII Units** and **university laboratories** specialized in biomechanics and rehabilitation.

Planned funding lines:

* **FAPESP / CNPq** – research and conceptual development grants.
* **FINEP / EMBRAPII** – prototype consolidation and validation testing.
* **BNDES – Industry 4.0** – equipment acquisition and production scaling.

---

## 6. Initial Action Plan

* Refinement of the prototype with high-precision sensors and actuators.
* Validation in a laboratory environment with volunteers.
* Study of economic and large-scale production feasibility.
* Structuring of a network of industrial and clinical partners for project expansion.
